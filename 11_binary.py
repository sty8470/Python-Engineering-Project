Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
1010, 1001, 100011, 1111, 1100, 111
Then the output should be:
