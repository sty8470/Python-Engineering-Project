'''
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 5000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
